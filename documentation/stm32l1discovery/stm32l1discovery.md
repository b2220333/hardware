## STM32L1 Discovery Kit

![](../../imgs/STM32L1DISCOVERY.jpg)

The STM32L1 Discovery Kit is an open hardware ultra low power and low-cost entry board for developing custom applications
with the STM32L152RCT6 Cortex M3 microcontrollers from STMicroelectronics. This board
has plenty of resources and all GPIO ports are available on extension connectors.
