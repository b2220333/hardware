This repository contains information and documentation about the hardware platforms
used and supported in the micro-ROS project.

### Reference hardware platform and development board
The reference hardware platform for the micro-ROS project is the STMicroelectronics
STM32F4 series of microcontrollers. Particularly, the reference development board is the
`Olimex LTD STM32-E407`. More information about this development board can be found in the
[Olimex LTD STM32-E407 instructions]() file.

### Other boards (*work in progress*)

- ultra low resources:
   - STM32VLDISCOVERY (STM32F1)
   - STM32L-DISCOVERY (STM32F4L1)
   - Nucleo-64 (STM32F103)
   - Nucleo-64 (STM32L152)
- low resources:
   - Olimex LTD STM32-E407
- safety-compliant:
   - Texas Instruments LAUNCHXL-TMS57004

### Supported micro-controllers
TODO: decide on whether it makes sense or not to list them.
